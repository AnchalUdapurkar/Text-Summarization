# Text-Summarization
This code summarizes a given text by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. 
It uses spaCy to process the text, removing stopwords and punctuation, and then calculates the frequency of each word. Sentences are scored based on the sum of the frequencies of the words they contain. The code then extracts the top-scoring sentences to form a summary, based on a predefined number of sentences (num_sentences). In the end, it prints the summary by selecting the most relevant sentences from the original text.Â¶
